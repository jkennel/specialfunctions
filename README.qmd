## Steps

-   Get gnstlib files from: https://github.com/guillermo-navas-palencia/gnstlib
-   Copy *.cpp* and *.hpp* files to src. *.hpp* files are placed in an include directory
-   Edit functions requiring quadmath.h. I couldn't figure out how to get this to compile with clang on mac m1 - right now I just convert to double and replace quadmath functions with standard ones. Eventually, I should learn how to do this correctly.
    -   expint_n_e_acc
-   Rewrite vectorization functions as needed. Remove omp.h and portions of functions that rely on it.
    -   vectorize_omp
-   Remove unused variables
    -   c, s in fresnels, fresnelsc
    -   shi_sign in shi
    -   mod in chi
    -   a in sici
    -   ans in ei
    -   poly in loggamma_asymptotic
-   update makevars
